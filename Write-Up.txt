The data being analyzed is from the month of January in 2018, 2019 and 2020. I decided to look at the most popular bike stations in terms of use.

The most popular station for the three observed years was Pershing Square North by almost 10,000 uses.
I also noticed that Pershing Square South had over 10,000 trips as well.
This shows that Pershing Square has some of the most bike traffic in the city and that more stations may need to be added.

I also analyzed the times that each ride started and ended and found large spikes around 8AM and 5PM and that weekend usage is lower compared to weekday usage.
This most likely means that people are using these bikes to commute to and from work.
If we want to encourage more people to use our bikes, we should focus on adding stations near businesses and high residential areas.

I also added a section that shows when the last time a bike was used. This can be used to show bikes that may be in need of repair.
This information could also be used to identify any misplaced or stolen bikes as well.
The data shows that Bikeids 19810, 19814, 28222, 28637, and 31108 have not been used since the first day of January.
It is likely that these bikes are missing or in need of repair.
